    ## How it works
    
    This tool uses a machine learning model trained on hundreds of IELTS essays 
    to predict essay scores. The model analyzes:
    
    * Grammar and vocabulary usage
    * Essay structure and coherence
    * Argument development
    * Topic relevance
    
    ## IELTS Writing Task 2
    
    For best results, write an essay responding to an IELTS Task 2 prompt.

Its effects are already evident in rising global temperatures, more frequent extreme weather events, and melting polar ice caps. These environmental changes pose serious risks not only to natural ecosystems but also to human health, food security, and economic stability.

The primary cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation. Deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural practices also contribute significantly to the problem. If global emissions continue at their current pace, we could see catastrophic impacts within this century.

To mitigate climate change, immediate and coordinated action is necessary. Governments must implement policies that promote renewable energy sources like wind and solar, enforce regulations on emissions, and encourage sustainable practices across all sectors. International cooperation, such as the Paris Agreement, plays a crucial role in setting targets and holding countries accountable.

Individual actions are also important. People can reduce their carbon footprint by using public transportation, conserving energy, reducing meat consumption, and supporting eco-friendly companies. Education and awareness campaigns can help people understand the urgency of the situation and inspire behavioral change.

In conclusion, while climate change presents a daunting challenge, it also offers an opportunity for innovation and global solidarity. By embracing sustainability and making informed choices, both individuals and nations can contribute to a healthier planet for future generations."""
